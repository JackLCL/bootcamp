# Milvus performance with IVF_SQ8
This topic displays the performance of create_index & search with different index types in Milvus 1.1 for reference purposes. The test data uses 100m data from an open source dataset, sift1B, with 1 billion 128-dimensional vectors.

The following table displays the terms used in this topic:

| Term   | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| nq         | Number of vectors to query. The value is defined during search.    |
| topk       | The most similar topk search results.  |
| total_time | Total time for a batch search.                 |
| avg_time   | Average search time per vector.       |
| nprobe     | Number of buckets to search during a query. The value is defined during search.  |

Performance is correlated with nprobe. The greater the value of nprobe, the lower the performance, but the higher the accuracy. You can set nprobe per specific scenarios.

## Insert

During this test, the data was imported into Milvus in batches of 100,000, and it took about 1.2S to import 100,000 vectors of 128 dimensions.

## Create Index

IVF_SQ8 is a quantization-based index, index file size of sift100m data is much less than that of IVF_FLAT. GPU takes much less time to create an index than CPU does.

Parametersï¼š`nlist` = 4096, `index_file_size` = 2048

| Index Param (nlist) | CPU | GPU |
| ------------------- | --- | --- |
| 4096 | 1409.197s | 198.952s |

## Search

Search accuracy is relatively high when `nprobe` is large enough. With same parameters, search speed is faster than that of IVF_FLAT. Query time increases when `nq` or `nprobe` increases. When both `nprobe` and `nq` are large, search with GPU is faster than search with CPU.

### Recall

Search for 500 vectors and return the accuracy in %.
| Param (nprobe) | topk=1 | topk=10 | topk=100 | topk=500 |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | -------- | -------- |
| 1              | 48.2   | 41.7    | 35.9     | 31.2     |
| 64             | 97     | 97.3    | 97.3     | 96.6     |
| 128            | 98     | 98      | 98.4     | 98.4     |
