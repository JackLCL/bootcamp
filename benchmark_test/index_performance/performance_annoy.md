# Milvus performance with ANNOY
This topic displays the performance of create_index & search with different index types in Milvus 1.1 for reference purposes. The test data uses 100m data from an open source dataset, sift1B, with 1 billion 128-dimensional vectors.

The following table displays the terms used in this topic:

| Term   | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| nq         | Number of vectors to query. The value is defined during search.    |
| topk       | The most similar topk search results.  |
| total_time | Total time for a batch search.                 |
| avg_time   | Average search time per vector.       |
| n_trees | The number of methods of space division. |
| search_k | The number of nodes to search. -1 means 5% of the whole data. |

## Insert

During this test, the data was imported into Milvus in batches of 100,000, and it took about 1.2S to import 100,000 vectors of 128 dimensions.

## Create Index

ANNOY is a a tree-based index, currently only available for CPU version. The larger the n_trees, the larger the index file size and the more time it takes to create index. With similar recall rate, it takes less time to create index than graph-based indexes but more time-consuming than IVF indexes.

Parametersï¼š`index_file_size` = 2048

| Index Param  (n_trees)  | CPU         |
|-------------------------|-------------|
| 1                       | 638.354s    |
| 8                       | 2988.229s   |
| 16                      | 5314.657s   |
| 64                      | 20142.021s  |

## Search

Increasing `n_trees`/`search_k` improves accuracy. However, larger `search_k` means slower search speed. With similar recall rate, search using ANNOY is slower than using graph-based indexes while faster than using IVF_FLAT.


### Recall

Search for 500 vectors and return the accuracy in %.
