# Milvus performance with IVF_PQ
This topic displays the performance of create_index & search with different index types in Milvus 1.1 for reference purposes. The test data uses 100m data from an open source dataset, sift1B, with 1 billion 128-dimensional vectors.

The following table displays the terms used in this topic:

| Term   | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| nq         | Number of vectors to query. The value is defined during search.    |
| topk       | The most similar topk search results.  |
| total_time | Total time for a batch search.                 |
| avg_time   | Average search time per vector.       |
| nprobe     | Number of buckets to search during a query. The value is defined during search.  |

Performance is correlated with nprobe. The greater the value of nprobe, the lower the performance, but the higher the accuracy. You can set nprobe per specific scenarios.

## Insert

During this test, the data was imported into Milvus in batches of 100,000, and it took about 1.2S to import 100,000 vectors of 128 dimensions.

## Create Index

IVF_PQ is a quantization-based index. The index file is very small (about 4G), and the indexing speed is relatively fast. GPU creates index faster than CPU.

Parametersï¼š`index_file_size` = 2048

| Index Param (nlist/m/nbits) | CPU | GPU |
| ------------------- | --- | --- |
| 2048/32/8 | 739s  | 250s |
| 4096/32/8 | 1267s | 289s |

## Search

Search accuracy rate is very low (54% to 75%), the smaller the indexing parameter `m`, the lower the rate. The retrieval speed in the IVF index is the fastest (CPU) with the same parameters with lower accuracy. No matter how large the `nprobe`/`nq` is, the time is about 2s for GPU retrieval.


### Recall

Search for 500 vectors and return the accuracy in %.
