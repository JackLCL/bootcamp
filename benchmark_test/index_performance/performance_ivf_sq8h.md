# Milvus performance with IVF_SQ8H
This topic displays the performance of create_index & search with different index types in Milvus 1.1 for reference purposes. The test data uses 100m data from an open source dataset, sift1B, with 1 billion 128-dimensional vectors.

The following table displays the terms used in this topic:

| Term   | Description                                    |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| nq         | Number of vectors to query. The value is defined during search.    |
| topk       | The most similar topk search results.  |
| total_time | Total time for a batch search.                 |
| avg_time   | Average search time per vector.       |
| nprobe     | Number of buckets to search during a query. The value is defined during search.  |

Performance is correlated with nprobe. The greater the value of nprobe, the lower the performance, but the higher the accuracy. You can set nprobe per specific scenarios.

## Insert

During this test, the data was imported into Milvus in batches of 100,000, and it took about 1.2S to import 100,000 vectors of 128 dimensions.

## Create Index

IVF_SQ8H is the optimized version of IVF_SQ8 that requires both CPU and GPU to work. Unlike IVF_SQ8, IVF_SQ8H uses a GPU-based coarse quantizer, which greatly reduces time to quantize. IVF_SQ8H is only available with Milvus-GPU version & GPU enabled.

Parametersï¼š`nlist` = 4096, `index_file_size` = 2048

| Index Param (nlist) | GPU |
|---------------------|-----|
| 4096 | 182.694s |

## Search

When nq >= gpu_search_threshold, it is same as IVF_SQ8 using GPU. When nq < gpu_search_threshold, it uses both GPU & CPU to search. When nq is small, search is faster than IVF_SQ8 fully using GPU.

### Recall

Search for 500 vectors and return the accuracy in %.
